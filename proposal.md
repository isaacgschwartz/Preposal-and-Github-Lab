# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Turn Based Space Invaders


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A turn based take on Space Invaders that involves more skill than luck.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

It will be created using Turtle, and the player will be able to move once and shoot once during their turn, and then one of the monsters at the top of the screen will randomly shoot a bullet that could kill the player
depending on where they are positioned on the screen. There will be a few levels, and when you die you are reset back to level 1. I might also make a points system, but I'm not sure yet.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

a good outcome would be at least one working level.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be 3 levels.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the best outcome would be three working levels with a score counter, and additional things like a powerup that I could add if I have extra time.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to find images to represent the monsters, the player's space shuttle, and other objects in the game. I need to think about how the code will be structured that would make the most sense before I begin.
I will create a function to move the shuttle, a function to shoot, i will create an animation for the monsters coming onto the screen one by one, I will create a visual queue telling you to SHOOT or MOVE so
the player will know what they're supposed to do, and I will create code that checks to see if the player successfully shot a monster, as well as logic that won't allow the user to shoot a monster unless there are no
other monsters blocking the bullet's path.

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created the basic framework for the game and developed some functionality like moving, shooting, and making monsters disappear when shot.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I want to make the monsters shoot back, and I want to make the level reset after all the monsters are killed. I also might add a points counter.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

All problems I have encountered so far I have been able to find a solution for. For example, I created a dictionary that has turtle objects as the keys, and a boolean that
stores whether or not that turtle or 'monster' is dead or not.
